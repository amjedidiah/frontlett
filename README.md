## About
The name of our soolution is **EduKolab**.
It is a web app that:
- connects teachers in primary && secondary schools with international cooperations for training and certification as well as
- offers trained & certified teachers to schools && guardians for employment

## Why
The problem we set out to solve is that of 
_**insuuficient supply of qualified teachers in your community, Nigeria, as well as other developing countries**_.

This project is geared at addressing the [4th Sustainable Developemnt Goal of Education](https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg4)

EduKolab aims particularly to improve the quality of education provided to primary && secondary school students by improving the quality of the teachers, the people who pass on this knowledge. 
It is very important and relevant especially in this time for a good number of reasons notable among which are:
- We will help create job employments for teachers that have been laid off because of the economic crises resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic
- We will improve the quality of education in the country and hopefully Africa by improving the quality of knowledge && teaching methods employed by teachers to pass on knowledge

## Usage
URL to deployed staging-app is below
[EduKolab Staging App](https://edukolab-staging-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Setup
1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/BuildForSDG/EduKolab-Frontend.git edukolab`
2. Verify npm global installation by running `npm install npm -g`
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the **edukolab** directory/folder
3. Start app locally by running `npm run dev` from the **edukolab** directory/folder

#### Hints
1. Get Started: `npm install`
2. Install additional dependencies: `npm install <dependency-name>`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
5. Run tests with test coverage info: `npm run test:cover`
6. Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `npm run lint`
7. Check the codebase for lint and test errors: `npm run check`
8. Build app for deployment: `npm run build`
9. Run app from build: `npm start`

If this project sounds interesting to you and you'd like to contribute, thank you!
First, you can send a mail to buildforsdg@andela.com copy imunacode@gmail.com to indicate your interest, why you'd like to support and what forms of support you can bring to the table, but here are areas we think we'd need the most help in this project :
1.  area one (e.g this app is about human trafficking and you need feedback on your roadmap and feature list from the private sector / NGOs)
2.  area two (e.g you want people to opt-in and try using your staging app at staging.project-name.com and report any bugs via a form)
3.  area three (e.g here is the zoom link to our end-of sprint webinar, join and provide feedback as a stakeholder if you can)

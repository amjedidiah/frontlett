A front-end test from ASIN5

## About
Implement design at https://www.figma.com/proto/61E8PV6ZSxC9J4esnP79pw/Frontlett

## Why
To qualify for a role on one of the teams at ASIN5

## Usage
URL to deployed staging-app is below
[Frontlett](https://amjedidiah.github.io/frontlett/)

## Setup
1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/amjedidiah/frontlett frontlett`
2. Verify npm global installation by running `npm install npm -g`
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install` from the **frontlett** directory/folder
3. Start app locally by running `npm run dev` from the **frontlett** directory/folder

#### Hints
1. Get Started: `npm install`
2. Install additional dependencies: `npm install <dependency-name>`
3. Run tests: `npm run test`
4. Run tests in watch mode: `npm run test:watch`
5. Run tests with test coverage info: `npm run test:cover`
6. Check the codebase for proper syntax and formatting compliance: `npm run lint`
7. Check the codebase for lint and test errors: `npm run check`
8. Build app for deployment: `npm run build`
9. Run app from build: `npm start`
10. Run app in local dev mode: `npm run dev`. 
- This first runs `npm run check` to check codebase for lint and test errors. If any are found, an npm error is thrown and the app exits with an error code
